## About us

 The Computer, Communication, Collaboration, Intelligence, and Privacy laboratory is committed to carry out internationally recognized research and industry projects in computer systems and networks security, and to teach students from the New York Institute of Technology - Vancouver Campus the practical aspects of cybersecurity. We strongly believe in problem driven, project oriented research, therefore we participate in R&D projects, where we collaborate with industry partners and academic institutions, and maintain international relationships.
